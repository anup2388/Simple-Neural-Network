# Simple-Neural-Network
Dataset used Iris Dataset
The Neural network consist of 3 layers
1 INPUT LAYER
1 HIDDEN LAYER 
1 OUTPUT LAYER

Here IRIS dataset is fed as input. The hidden layer consists of 5 nodes each with sigmoid activation function
Back propagation and Forward propagation is used in NN

Finally the efficiency is printed.
